You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

  * I've finished my first project here.
It took a long time to complete as it was my introduction to web development. But, I learnt so many things during the hole process and now I'm ready for next.
Well, I had learnt HTML, CSS and JavaScript before but, here in I'm learning how to implement all these things.
I did research for getting more to solve the problems. I learnt about how to design a website and a lot more...


  *As I have some idea about HTML so it was quite easy for me to complete it.
  

  *Nothing has been difficult.
But, I did not have any idea about GitHub, CodePen and Slack as well, so I started learning about all of this first.
So, It was quite slow.


  *It was a great learning experience.
The One thing I conformed when I finished this first project that, in the end of this course I'll find the best version of me and I'll give my best for that.
So, Thanks to GoogleUdacity.
